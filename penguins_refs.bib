	title = {Phenotypic selection on morphology at independence in the {Chinstrap} penguin {Pygoscelis} antarctica},
	abstract = {Every year, shortly after the emancipation of chicks at our study colony (Deception Island, South Shetlands), hundreds of carcasses of presumably starved Chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica chicks are washed on the shore. In 1997 we measured the flippers of fresh carcasses and compared their lengths with those of live chicks about to become independent. There was a highly significant difference of 6.5 mm between both distributions, which suggests strong directional phenotypic selection on skeletal size operating through its association with body reserves at independence. Given that heritabilities of flipper length and body weight measured on 36 families are 0.73(+ 0.32) and 0.075(+ 0.081), and that both characters show a genetic correlation of 0.44(+ 0.14), we can expect an evolutionary response to this selection episode. Assuming that the target of selection is weight at emancipation (heavier chicks carry proportionally larger reserves), and that flipper length changes as a consequence of its genetic correlation with weight, we can predict a response of 1.32—2.87 mm or 0.23-0.51 standard deviation units for flipper length. This substantial evolutionary response may be countered by other selective pressures affecting other life stages of these birds. Selection on reserve storage capacity at independence may affect morphological traits also in other species.},

	title = {Palmer {Archipelago} {Penguins} {Data} in the palmerpenguins {R} {Package} - {An} {Alternative} to {Anderson}’s {Irises}},
	volume = {14},
	abstract = {In 1935, Edgar Anderson collected size measurements for 150 flowers from three species of Iris on the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec, Canada. Since then, Anderson’s Iris observations have become a classic dataset in statistics, machine learning, and data science teaching materials. It is included in the base R datasets package as iris, making it easy for users to access without knowing much about it. However, the lack of data documentation, presence of non-intuitive variables (e.g. “sepal width”), and perfectly balanced groups with zero missing values make iris an inadequate and stale dataset for teaching and learning modern data science skills. Users would benefit from working with a more representative, real-world environmental dataset with a clear link to current scientific research. Importantly, Anderson’s Iris data appeared in a 1936 publication by R. A. Fisher in the Annals of Eugenics (which is often the first-listed citation for the dataset), inextricably linking iris to eugenics research. Thus, a modern alternative to iris is needed. In this paper, we introduce the palmerpenguins R package (Horst et al., 2020), which includes body size measurements collected from 2007 - 2009 for three species of Pygoscelis penguins that breed on islands throughout the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The penguins dataset in palmerpenguins provides an approachable, charismatic, and near drop-in replacement for iris with topical relevance for polar climate change and environmental impacts on marine predators. Since the release on CRAN in July 2020, the palmerpenguins package has been downloaded over 462,000 times, highlighting the demand and widespread adoption of this viable iris alternative. We directly compare the iris and penguins datasets for selected analyses to demonstrate that R users, in particular teachers and learners currently using iris, can switch to the Palmer Archipelago penguins for many use cases including data wrangling, visualization, linear modeling, multivariate analysis (e.g., PCA), cluster analysis and classification (e.g., by k-means).},

	title = {Ecological {Sexual} {Dimorphism} and {Environmental} {Variability} within a {Community} of {Antarctic} {Penguins} ({Genus} {Pygoscelis})},
	volume = {9},
	abstract = {Background: Sexual segregation in vertebrate foraging niche is often associated with sexual size dimorphism (SSD), i.e., ecological sexual dimorphism. Although foraging behavior of male and female seabirds can vary markedly, differences in isotopic (carbon, d13C and nitrogen, d15N) foraging niche are generally more pronounced within sexually dimorphic species and during phases when competition for food is greater. We examined ecological sexual dimorphism among sympatric nesting Pygoscelis penguins asking whether environmental variability is associated with differences in male and female prebreeding foraging niche. We predicted that all Pygoscelis species would forage sex-specifically, and that higher quality winter habitat, i.e., higher or lower sea ice coverage for a given species, would be associated with a more similar foraging niche among the sexes.
Results: P2/P8 primers reliably amplified DNA of all species. On average, male Pygoscelis penguins are structurally larger than female conspecifics. However, chinstrap penguins were more sexually dimorphic in culmen and flipper features than Ade´lie and gentoo penguins. Ade´lies and gentoos were more sexually dimorphic in body mass than chinstraps. Only male and female chinstraps and gentoos occupied separate d15N foraging niches. Strong year effects in d15N signatures were documented for all three species, however, only for Ade´lies, did yearly variation in d15N signatures tightly correlate with winter sea ice conditions. There was no evidence that variation in sex-specific foraging niche interacted with yearly winter habitat quality.
Conclusion: Chinstraps were most sexually size dimorphic followed by gentoos and Ade´lies. Pre-breeding sex-specific foraging niche was associated with overall SSD indices across species; male chinstrap and gentoo penguins were enriched in d15N relative to females. Our results highlight previously unknown trophic pathways that link Pygoscelis penguins with variation in Southern Ocean sea ice suggesting that each sex within a species should respond similarly in pre-breeding trophic foraging to changes in future winter habitat.},
